  Detect if a user is angry/frustrated in their message and *automatically* escalate to a human specialist, bypassing the AI.

## 👥 User Experience

  Add "points" for active partners (e.g., for reading news, resolving polls).
- [ ] **Referral System.**  
  "Invite a colleague" feature with tracking in Google Sheets.

## 🛠 Admin Tools
